"""The route graph is frozen: frontends may move from decorators to the mount table, not change.

tests/fixtures/route_graph_frozen.json is the graph of origin/main before the frontends mounted
from registry/protocol_frontends.yml. Every frozen route, dispatch outcome, policy projection and
OpenAPI digest must still be there. A route may be added only where ADDED_PATHS names its path
and says why. Nothing may be removed, re-handled, re-methoded or re-policied.
