"""Publish a config the way a reload does, for a test that swaps ``proxy.config`` and reads ``proxy.runtime()``.

``runtime()`` answers the published snapshot only, so ``monkeypatch.setattr(proxy, "config", cfg)`` alone is not seen by
code that reads the snapshot (the decision runtime, the mesh frontend records). The autouse fixture in
``tests/conftest.py`` puts the holder back after the test.
