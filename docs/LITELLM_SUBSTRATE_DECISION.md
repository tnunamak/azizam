# LiteLLM Substrate Decision

Status: adopted.

LiteLLM is the gateway's commodity LLM execution substrate. It owns
OpenAI-shaped LLM execution and model-group discovery for:

- `/v1/chat/completions`
- `/v1/completions`
- `/v1/embeddings`
- `/v1/models` LLM entries

The AI Gateway owns the product/control-plane responsibilities around that
substrate:

- runtime App keys, OIDC users, Profiles, and policy gates
- local service availability, resource admission, and model readiness
- media workflows, durable jobs, generated assets, and provider-native passthrough
- Anthropic/Ollama/Responses protocol frontends where the gateway has product
  semantics that LiteLLM does not own
- receipts, activity, admin UX, and discovery metadata

The boundary is deliberately strict:

1. Gateway authenticates and policy-gates the request.
2. Gateway prepares local resources only when the requested LiteLLM model group
   maps to a gateway-declared local target.
3. LiteLLM executes the commodity LLM request.
4. Gateway records receipts and returns the provider-compatible response.

There is no legacy local executor fallback for OpenAI-shaped LLM routes. If the
LiteLLM substrate is not configured or unavailable, those routes fail clearly
instead of silently routing to Tabby, Kobold, or an embeddings server.

LiteLLM configuration is a generated artifact from the gateway service registry.
The service registry remains the source of truth; generated LiteLLM YAML must not
be edited as product configuration.
